1.Frequency Counting pattern :
Use Frequency counting pattern when the order doesn't matter.
Avoid frequency counting when:

Order matters (subarrays, sequences)

Continuous range logic (sliding window fits better)

Index-based problems (two pointers often better)

1️⃣ Sliding Window (MOST COMMON when order matters)
Use this when:

You need a continuous subarray / substring

The window moves left → right

You’re asked for:

max / min / longest / shortest

sum / average

number of valid subarrays

2️⃣ Two Pointers (order matters, but not necessarily continuous)
Use this when:

You have sorted data

You compare elements from both ends

You move pointers based on conditions

Question says…	Use this pattern
Subarray / substring	Sliding Window
Sorted + pair	Two Pointers
Range sum	Prefix Sum
Find min/max answer	Binary Search
Next / previous element	Stack
Order doesn’t matter	Frequency Counting
