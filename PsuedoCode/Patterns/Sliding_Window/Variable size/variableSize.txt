Example problem description:
Leetcode problem #209
Given an array of positive integers nums and a positive integer target, return the minimal length of a subarray whose sum is greater than or equal to target. If there is no such subarray, return 0 instead

start = 0
sum = 0
answer = infinity  # or 0 depending on problem

for end in range(0, n):
    sum += nums[end]     # expand the window

    while condition is satisfied:
        update answer (like minLen, maxLen, etc.)
        sum -= nums[start]   # shrink from the left
        start += 1
