🔥 Greedy Problem Identification & Solving Pattern

Greedy problems are not about formulas — they are about safe local decisions.

1️⃣ How to IDENTIFY a greedy problem

Ask these questions (in this order):

✅ Q1: Is the problem asking for

maximum / minimum?

feasible / possible?

earliest / latest?

farthest / closest?

👉 Strong greedy signal.

✅ Q2: Can I make a decision step-by-step?

If you can say:

“At this step, I can decide something without knowing the future”

→ likely greedy.

✅ Q3: If a choice fails, can I discard a range of choices?

This is the BIG hint (Gas Station case).

Examples:

If start i fails → discard [i … j]

If jump fails → discard earlier jumps

If interval overlaps → discard one interval

✅ Q4: Does sorting help?

Many greedy problems start with:

sorting by end time

sorting by size

sorting by position

If sorting simplifies decisions → greedy.

2️⃣ Core Greedy Mental Pattern (VERY IMPORTANT)

Make the best local choice that does not break global feasibility

You must always be able to say:

“This choice will never hurt an optimal solution.”

3️⃣ Universal Greedy PSEUDOCODE Template
🔹 Pattern 1: Elimination-based greedy (Gas Station, Jump Game)
initialize globalCheck
initialize localState
initialize candidateAnswer

for each element in order:
    update globalCheck
    update localState

    if localState becomes invalid:
        eliminate all previous candidates
        move candidateAnswer forward
        reset localState

if globalCheck is valid:
    return candidateAnswer
else:
    return failure

Used in:

Gas Station

Jump Game

Split Array problems

Prefix sum greedy

4️⃣ Greedy with Sorting (Intervals, Scheduling)
sort input by greedy key (end time / position / size)

initialize result
initialize lastChosen

for each item:
    if item is compatible with lastChosen:
        choose item
        update lastChosen

Used in:

Meeting Rooms

Non-overlapping intervals

Activity selection

5️⃣ Greedy with Max / Min Tracking
initialize bestSoFar
initialize answer

for each element:
    update bestSoFar
    update answer using bestSoFar

Used in:

Stock buy/sell

Max subarray

Best time problems

6️⃣ Gas Station — Greedy Pattern Applied
total = 0
current = 0
start = 0

for i from 0 to n-1:
    gain = gas[i] - cost[i]
    total += gain
    current += gain

    if current < 0:
        start = i + 1
        current = 0

if total >= 0:
    return start
else:
    return -1


Pattern type: Elimination-based greedy

7️⃣ How to TRAIN greedy thinking (important)
❌ Don’t do this

Jump straight to proof

Try all possibilities

Use nested loops

✅ Do this instead

Try brute-force once

Observe why it fails

Ask: “Can I discard choices permanently?”

Write a rule to discard

Prove later

8️⃣ One-line greedy checklist (memorize this)

If a local failure makes future choices worse, discard it permanently.

9️⃣ Problems to practice with this mindset

If you want to master greedy, practice in this order:

Gas Station

Jump Game

Jump Game II

Maximum Subarray

Non-overlapping Intervals

Partition Labels

(All use the patterns above)

🔒 Final takeaway

Greedy = safe local choice

Pattern > formula

Proof validates, logic guides

Elimination is the strongest greedy signal
